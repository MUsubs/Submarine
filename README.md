The Submarine project is a combination of many components, divided into three categories:
1. Autonomous Navigation with Computer Vision (NAV), a land-side portion consisting of a Computer Vision model which tracks the position of the Submarine, as well as being part of the main control application.
2. Submarine Control (ASN), a submarine-side portion in charge of all the actuators in the Submarine, acting on commands gotten from Autonomous Navigation to make the Submarine sail.
3. Data Transmission and Gathering (SEN), the bridge between land- and submarine-side components using IR data transmission, as well as commanding the sensors aboard the vessel.
